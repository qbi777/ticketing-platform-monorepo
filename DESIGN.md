# Design Document: Dynamic Event Ticketing Platform

## Executive Summary

This document explains the architectural decisions, implementation approach, and technical trade-offs made in building a full-stack event ticketing platform with dynamic pricing and concurrency control.

---

## 1. Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

### Implementation Approach

The pricing engine calculates ticket prices in real-time based on three weighted factors:

**Formula:**
```
currentPrice = basePrice × (1 + Σ(adjustment × weight))

Where:
- timeAdjustment: Price increase based on event proximity
- demandAdjustment: Price increase based on booking velocity
- inventoryAdjustment: Price increase based on ticket scarcity
```

### Design Decisions

#### **1.1 Rule-Based Architecture**

I implemented each pricing rule as an independent, injectable service:
```typescript
interface PricingRule {
  calculate(): number;  // Returns adjustment factor (0.0 to 1.0+)
}
```

**Why this approach:**
- **Modularity**: Each rule can be tested, updated, or replaced independently
- **Extensibility**: New rules can be added without modifying existing code
- **Testability**: Each rule can be unit tested in isolation
- **Configurability**: Rules are stored as JSON in the database, allowing per-event customization

#### **1.2 Time-Based Pricing**

Implements urgency-driven pricing as events approach:
```
30+ days out: 0% increase (no urgency)
7-30 days: 10% increase (moderate urgency)
1-7 days: 20% increase (high urgency)
< 24 hours: 50% increase (critical urgency)
```

**Design rationale:**
- Simple time buckets are easy to understand and predict
- Gradual increases encourage early booking
- Steep final increase creates urgency for procrastinators

#### **1.3 Demand-Based Pricing**

Tracks booking velocity to detect high-demand periods:
```typescript
const recentBookings = bookings in last 60 minutes;
if (recentBookings >= threshold) {
  priceAdjustment = 0.15;  // 15% increase
}
```

**Why 60-minute window:**
- Short enough to be responsive to demand spikes
- Long enough to avoid price volatility from individual bookings
- Prevents gaming the system with delayed bookings

**Alternative considered:**
- Rolling average over 24 hours (rejected: too slow to react)
- Per-minute tracking (rejected: too volatile, confusing for users)

#### **1.4 Inventory-Based Pricing**

Implements scarcity pricing based on remaining capacity:
```
80%+ available: 0% increase
50-80% available: 10% increase
20-50% available: 25% increase
< 20% available: 50% increase
```

**Design rationale:**
- Psychological effect: Scarcity creates urgency
- Revenue optimization: Extract maximum value from last tickets
- Protects against mass last-minute bookings depleting inventory

#### **1.5 Weighted Combination**

Default weights (configurable per event):
```
timeWeight: 0.33 (33%)
demandWeight: 0.33 (33%)
inventoryWeight: 0.34 (34%)
```

**Why equal weights:**
- No single factor dominates pricing
- Balanced response to different market conditions
- Simplifies understanding for event organizers

**Floor and ceiling constraints:**
```typescript
finalPrice = Math.max(priceFloor, Math.min(priceCeiling, calculatedPrice));
```

Prevents extreme price movements while preserving dynamic adjustments.

## 2. Concurrency Control Solution

### The Problem

Without locking, two users can simultaneously book the last ticket:
```
Time | User A                    | User B
-----|---------------------------|---------------------------
T0   | SELECT (1 ticket left)    |
T1   |                           | SELECT (1 ticket left)
T2   | CHECK: 1 >= 1 ✓           |
T3   |                           | CHECK: 1 >= 1 ✓ (RACE!)
T4   | INSERT booking            |
T5   |                           | INSERT booking (OVERSOLD!)
```

### Implementation

I used PostgreSQL row-level locking with transactions:
```typescript
await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Step 1: Lock event row (blocks other transactions)
  const [event] = await tx.execute(
    sql`SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = ${eventId} FOR UPDATE`
  );
  
  // Step 2: Check availability (guaranteed consistent read)
  if (event.total_tickets - event.booked_tickets < quantity) {
    throw new Error('Not enough tickets');
  }
  
  // Step 3: Create booking
  await tx.insert(bookings).values({...});
  
  // Step 4: Update ticket count atomically
  await tx.update(events).set({
    bookedTickets: event.booked_tickets + quantity
  });
  
  // Transaction commits - lock released
});
```

### How It Prevents Overbooking
```
Time | User A                    | User B
-----|---------------------------|---------------------------
T0   | BEGIN TRANSACTION         |
T1   | SELECT ... FOR UPDATE     |
T2   | (acquires lock)           |
T3   |                           | BEGIN TRANSACTION
T4   |                           | SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
T5   |                           | (WAITS for lock...)
T6   | CHECK: 1 >= 1 ✓           |
T7   | INSERT booking            |
T8   | UPDATE tickets            |
T9   | COMMIT (releases lock)    |
T10  |                           | (lock acquired)
T11  |                           | CHECK: 0 >= 1 ✗ FAILS ✓
T12  |                           | ROLLBACK
```

### Design Trade-offs

**Chosen: Pessimistic Locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE)**

Advantages:
- ✅ Guarantees correctness (no race conditions possible)
- ✅ Simple to implement and reason about
- ✅ No retry logic needed
- ✅ Works with any database supporting transactions

Disadvantages:
- ❌ Serializes concurrent bookings for same event
- ❌ Potential bottleneck for high-traffic events

**Alternative considered: Optimistic Locking**
```typescript
// Read version
const event = await db.select().from(events).where(eq(events.id, id));

// Update with version check
const result = await db.update(events)
  .set({ bookedTickets: event.bookedTickets + 1, version: event.version + 1 })
  .where(and(eq(events.id, id), eq(events.version, event.version)));

if (result.rowCount === 0) {
  // Version mismatch - retry
}
```

**Why I didn't choose this:**
- Requires retry logic (complex)
- Poor user experience on retries
- Higher code complexity
- Not significantly better performance for our use case

### Testing Strategy

Automated test proves correctness:
```typescript
it('prevents overbooking with concurrent requests', async () => {
  // Setup: Event with 1 ticket
  const eventId = await createEvent({ totalTickets: 1 });
  
  // Execute: 2 simultaneous bookings
  const [response1, response2] = await Promise.all([
    bookTicket(eventId, 'user1@test.com'),
    bookTicket(eventId, 'user2@test.com'),
  ]);
  
  // Assert: Exactly 1 succeeds, 1 fails
  const successful = [response1, response2].filter(r => r.success);
  expect(successful).toHaveLength(1);
  
  // Verify: Only 1 booking in database
  const bookings = await getBookings(eventId);
  expect(bookings).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

## 3. Monorepo Architecture

### Structure
```
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # NestJS backend (REST API)
│   └── web/          # Next.js frontend (SSR)
├── packages/
│   ├── database/     # Drizzle ORM + schemas
│   ├── ui/           # Shared React components
│   ├── eslint-config/
│   └── typescript-config/
└── turbo.json        # Build orchestration
```

### Design Decisions

#### **3.1 Why Turborepo?**

- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuilds changed packages
- **Task orchestration**: Parallel execution of dev servers
- **Caching**: Dramatically faster CI/CD pipelines
- **Developer experience**: Single `pnpm dev` starts everything

#### **3.2 Shared Database Package**

Centralizing database logic provides:
- **Single source of truth** for schema definitions
- **Type safety** across frontend and backend
- **Consistent migrations** applied once
- **Reusable queries** and utilities

**Trade-off**: Backend and frontend must use compatible ORM versions.

#### **3.3 NestJS vs Express**

I chose NestJS because:
- ✅ Built-in dependency injection (easier testing)
- ✅ Decorator-based routing (cleaner syntax)
- ✅ Native TypeScript support
- ✅ Structured architecture (modules, services, controllers)

**Alternative considered: Express**
- Simpler but requires more boilerplate
- Less opinionated (can be good or bad)

## 4. Database Design

### Schema
```sql
-- Events: Core event information
events {
  id, name, date, venue, description,
  totalTickets, bookedTickets,
  basePrice, currentPrice, priceFloor, priceCeiling,
  pricingRules (JSONB),
  status, organizerId
}

-- Bookings: Transaction records
bookings {
  id, eventId, userEmail, quantity,
  pricePaid,  -- Snapshot of price at booking time
  bookingTimestamp, status
}

-- Users: Account management
users {
  id, email, name, role
}
```

### Key Decisions

#### **4.1 Storing pricePaid**

I store the exact price paid (not a reference) because:
- Price is dynamic and changes constantly
- Historical records must be immutable
- Users need proof of what they paid
- Analytics requires accurate revenue tracking

#### **4.2 Pricing Rules as JSONB**

Storing rules as JSON provides:
- **Flexibility**: Different events can have different rules
- **No schema changes** when adding new rule types
- **Easy configuration** via admin UI

**Trade-off**: Cannot query/index rule components efficiently (acceptable for our use case).

#### **4.3 Denormalized bookedTickets**

Instead of `COUNT(bookings)`, I store `bookedTickets` directly:
- ✅ O(1) availability checks (critical for performance)
- ✅ Simpler queries
- ✅ Atomic updates with FOR UPDATE
- ❌ Requires careful synchronization

## 5. Frontend Architecture

### Next.js 15 App Router

**Server Components** for data fetching:
```typescript
// app/events/page.tsx
export default async function EventsPage() {
  const events = await fetchEvents();  // Runs on server
  return <EventList events={events} />;
}
```

**Client Components** for interactivity:
```typescript
'use client';
export function BookingForm() {
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
  // Interactive form logic
}
```

### Design Rationale

- **SEO-friendly**: Events are server-rendered
- **Fast initial load**: No client-side JS for listing
- **Progressive enhancement**: Interactive forms load separately
- **Type safety**: Shared types from database package

## 6. What I Would Improve

### With More Time

1. **Real-time Price Updates**
   - WebSocket connection for live price changes
   - Currently: Manual refresh required
   
2. **Advanced Caching**
   - Redis for event data (reduce DB load)
   - CDN for static assets
   
3. **Payment Integration**
   - Stripe/PayPal for actual transactions
   - Refund handling
   
4. **Email Notifications**
   - SendGrid for booking confirmations
   - Reminder emails before events
   
5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Event management UI
   - Analytics and reporting
   - Pricing rule configuration
   
6. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based auth
   - OAuth (Google, GitHub)
   - User profiles
   
7. **Testing Coverage**
   - Expand to 90%+ coverage
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Load testing with k6
   
8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Database query optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Horizontal scaling strategies

### Trade-offs Made

1. **Simplified authentication**: Email-only bookings
   - Quick implementation
   - Good enough for MVP
   - Real app needs proper auth

2. **Client-side booking search**: Not implemented fully
   - Would require backend endpoint
   - Out of scope for assignment

3. **No seat selection**: Simple quantity-based booking
   - Seat maps add complexity
   - Not required for core functionality
